### Exploring Regions and Availability Zones in Azure

1. **Regions**:
   - Azure has multiple **Regions**, each representing a specific geographical location where Azure data centers are located.
   - Examples of regions include:
     - **East US**
     - **West Europe**
     - **Southeast Asia**
   - Regions allow you to deploy resources closer to your users, reducing latency and improving performance.

2. **Availability Zones**:
   - **Availability Zones** are physical locations within an Azure region. Each zone has independent power, cooling, and networking.
   - They provide high availability and resilience by distributing resources across multiple zones within a region.
   - Using Availability Zones helps ensure that your applications remain available even if one zone experiences issues.
